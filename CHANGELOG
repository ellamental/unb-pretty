0.0.3
=====

- Move to prefixed names (ex: `$list--unstyled` instead of `$unstyled-list`).

- Add Google Material Icons

- Prefix icon function names (ex: `icon--fa(user)` and `icon--mi(build)`).

- Add `$link--no-outline`.

- Add modules/misc for random stuff.

- Try to normalize icon fonts a bit... This is going to be difficult since the
  icon sizes will vary between sets.  Normalizing `font-size` and `line-height`
  isn't sufficient.


0.0.2
=====

- Convert to placeholder selectors for ``@extend``-able classes!

  This means that only the placeholder classes that are extended by user code
  will be included in the output css.  This is a huge win in the battle against
  framework bloat, and allows the UNB Pretty library to grow arbitrarily large
  without affecting the user.

  This also encourages the user to not use UNB Pretty classes directly in their
  html.  Hopefully users realize that they can now use semantic class names and
  ``@extend`` them with the placeholder classes.  However, this "best practice"
  needs to be better documented with examples and rationales.

- Set config values using dot notation.

  This makes the default config file cleaner and more readable.

- Split UNB Pretty into modules.

  This allows the user to import only the parts of UNB Pretty they want (though
  this isn't much of a concern now that UNB Pretty classes have been converted
  to placeholders).  It also helps organize the library for developer sanity.

- Add some reStructuredText docs in the /docs/ directory.

- Update the README

- Move configuration from var.styl to config.styl.

- Change the way configuration is handled to allow the user to use hash
  notation to override config values even before importing unb-pretty/config.


0.0.1
=====

- Ported unb-pretty to a separate package.
